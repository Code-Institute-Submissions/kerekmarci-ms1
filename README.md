### Surface

* Theme:
One of the main goals of the website is to be visually appealing and to convey the feeling of the gym. A dark background can add a dynamic feel to the website,
therefore I chose to have a dark landing page. Further idea was to select colours that compliment dark colours well, and the colours I selected are grey, white and a variant of red.

* Colours
