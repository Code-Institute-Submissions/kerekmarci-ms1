### Surface

* **Theme:**
One of the main goals of the website is to be visually appealing and to convey the feeling of the gym. A dark background can add a dynamic feel to the website,
therefore I chose to have a dark landing page. Further idea was to select colours that compliment dark colours well, and the colours I selected are grey, white and a variant of red.

* **Colours:**
When determining colours, it was important that they are in harmony, have enough colours to cover the whole range of website, although not too many as that would work against consisntency. 
I wanted all the colours to give a consistent feel throughout the website, as well as be visually pleasing for the eye and have enough contrast between them to support easy reading.

For the dark theme, I selected an off-black as an alternateive, with colour code #222222.\
The main complimentary colour of black is white, with colour code #FFFFFF. The section backgrounds can alter in between these two colours. \
For elements slightly lighter than black I have chosem a dark grey with colour code #383838.\
For the paragraphs, I selected a light grey that is good fit in the pallette, yet dark enough to be visible on a white background - its colour code is #9B9B9B.\
Red is a great complimentary colour for black, I've selected an alternateive with colour code #DB4749.

The colours in a pallette can be seen here:

* **Typography:**

Consisntency was also a key when selecting fonts, that a complimentary to each other and provide a visually appealing consisntency throughout the site.

* The main headlines and titles are *Oswald*
* The main paragraph text is *Source Sans Pro*
* For the titles of smaller, yet important paragrahps, *Raleway* will be used
* For the main landing page, for the motivational text below the carousel, I was looking for sans serif font that is a goof fit for a quick description. *PT Sans* seemed to be a good fit which is based on Russian sans serif font types 

* **Icons:**

FontAwesome icons are used across the website for highlighting features of the gym and social links. 

* **Other aesthetic adjustments**

To the benefit or colour harmony, the images on the carousel have been adjusted to better fit the overall colour scheme of the site.\
For example, this photo had originally a cool tone and yellow bars, however, altering the overall feel towards a warmer red makes it a better fit to the dark-red complimentary colours already used on the site.
